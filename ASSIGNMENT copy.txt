4. Music: when a level starts, an audio file should be played (/src/audio/maze.mp3)
   in a loop until the end of the level (or until game is over).

   When the user reaches the goal, the music is stopped and instead the 'level end tune' is played
   (in src\audio\level_end.mp3).

5. Only after the 'level end tune' finishes to play we move to the next level -
   a new maze is generated, the round is increased by one, the time gets reset to 60 seconds,
   and the annoying music starts from the beginning.
