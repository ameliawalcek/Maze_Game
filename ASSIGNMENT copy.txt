4. Music: when a level starts, an audio file should be played (/src/audio/maze.mp3)
   in a loop until the end of the level (or until game is over).

5. Only after the 'level end tune' finishes to play we move to the next level -
   a new maze is generated, the round is increased by one, the time gets reset to 60 seconds,
   and the annoying music starts from the beginning.
